# Overview
Evaluation campaigns, where researchers share important tasks, collaboratively develop test collections, and have discussion to advance technologies, are still important events to strategically address core challenges in information access research. 
  The goal of this workshop is to discuss information access tasks that are worth addressing as a community, share new resources and evaluation methodologies,
  and encourage researchers to ultimately propose new evaluation campaigns in  NTCIR, TREC, CLEF, FIRE, etc.
  The proposed workshop accepts four types of contributions, namely, 
  emerging task, ongoing task, resource, and evaluation papers.
